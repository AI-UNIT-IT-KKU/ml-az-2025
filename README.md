# 🚀 Machine Learning A–Z [2025] – Python Track

This repository contains my **implementation and study notes** for the Udemy course:  
**“Machine Learning A–Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2025]”**.  

It focuses on the **Python track** and organizes the material into clear, reproducible notebooks with detailed explanations.

- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebooks for each course part  
- `docs/` → Extra notes, references, and supporting material  
- `data/` → Datasets used in the notebooks

## 📖 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on teaching computers to **learn from data** and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.  

In this course we cover a wide range of ML techniques, from simple regression models to more advanced methods like deep learning and natural language processing.

## 📊 Types of Data

In ML we usually deal with two types of data:  

- **Labeled Data (Supervised)** → Each input has a known output.  
  Example: Study hours → Pass/Fail label.  

- **Unlabeled Data (Unsupervised)** → We only have inputs, no outputs.  
  Example: Customer income & spending data without categories.  

- **Interaction Data (Reinforcement)** → The agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.  
  Example: A robot learning to walk.  

---

## 🌱 Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning** → Learn from labeled data (Regression, Classification).  
- **Unsupervised Learning** → Find patterns in unlabeled data (Clustering, Association Rules, Dimensionality Reduction).  
- **Reinforcement Learning** → Learn through actions, rewards, and penalties.  

These categories form the foundation of all the algorithms covered in the course.
